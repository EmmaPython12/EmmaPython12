- 👋 Hi, I’m @EmmaPython12
- 👀 I’m a visual artist interested in taking a deep dive into Python, Machine Learning, and AI for the purposes of generating art.  Previously, I was a litigator.  Since 2015, I have studied and practiced art.  In 2022, I completed a full stack (MERN) bootcamp.  This has helped me in beginning to understand the generative art process.     
- 🌱 I’m currently learning stable diffusion and ways to fine-tune text to image and image-to-image art generation.  I am documenting the process.  I also work digitally and on canvas (with acrylic paint).  It is important that my art process reflects the way we live our lives - both on and off screens.   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with others that share similar interests.  :) 
- 📫 How to reach me.  You can message me at iam@valluna.art.
